Conditional Statements : 
------------------------

.Conditional statements are nothing but which controls the execution flow in  a program.

let me explain it in laymen terms , i dont the balance in my account i thought of going out to have something . on the way i came  across
one biryani center and  a samosa shop then ,i decided that if my bank balance is more than 100 then i would eat biryani if not i would eat samosa.

Like in the real world we have to take decisions based on certain conditions similarly to make decisions in a program based on any condition we use conditional statements

They are :

1.if
2.if else
3.if else if
4.switch

1.if(balance > 100){
    //eat biryani
}

2.if(balance > 100){
    //eat biryani
}else{
    //eat samosa
}

3.if(balance > 200){
    //have both biryani and cool drink
}else if(balance > 100){
    //have biryani
}else{
    //have tea
}

4.switch(day){
case 1:
//it is sunday
break;
case 2:
//it is monday
break;
case 3:
//it is tuesday
break;
case 4:
//it is wednsday
break;
case 5:
//it is thursday
break;
case 6:
